I am using the wiki page on this repository to take notes while following the GIS courses on Linkedin Learning.

[^1]: See the link to the course [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/foundations-of-geographic-information-systems-gis/thinking-spatially) 

- A Geographic Information System (GIS) software gives you the tools to create, modify, and manipulate data to tease out critical pattern and expose the way things interact with each other on the ground.

- This course covers:
    * how GIS is used in various industries.
    * components of a GIS
    * where to find geospatial data
    * how the essential elements of the GIS come together to help answer questions and solve problems

- putting the data on a map
